Ritvik Shyam, Imperial College London

Googleâ€™s Coding Challenge for Bright Network Technology Virtual Internship 2021 involving implementing various components of a command-line application
simulating YouTube. The specification and base code  can be found here: https://github.com/internship-experience-uk/google-code-sample. For the final submission, I have implemented it using Python. This challenge can be extended by completing the extra extension parts of the specification and also trying to successfully implement a C++ version.
